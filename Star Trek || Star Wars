I prefer the Star Trek universe.  The Star Trek universe seems more realistic to me as a society.
Star Wars literally has a "dark side."  Star Trek villians have real justifications for their
grievances.  They're homeworld was destroyed by Star Fleet for examples.  In Star Wars, the villains
and their armies don't even try to morally justify their actions.  I think the books may actually
have more subtle arguments about the light and dark side, but the movies have an exaggerated
dictatorial dark side.  In a technologically advanced society, like those depicted in Stark Trek and
Star Wars, I expect exploration, both scientific and astronomical, will be all there is left.  A
society built entirely around these endeavors (Star Fleet) seems like a logical result.  I don't know
enough about either show to have a strong opinion, but Star Trek seems more realistic from what I've
seen.

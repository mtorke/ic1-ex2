I am interested in robotics and Computer Engineering has classes in an Embedded Systems focus track.  Electrical Engineering is relevant, but I thought Computer Engineering courses would cover more practical knowledge that I completely lack.  As a physics graduate, my education is further removed from Computer Engineering, so I thought that would be a more worthwhile education.
